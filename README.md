# MonsterMasters
Just a project to do for fun and learn new technologies while I do so. I don't own the images that I use so don't sue me.

## Technologies used:
- Back-end with ASP.NET Core API
- Front-end with Angular 12 
- Database with Entity Framework and MSSQL


## New to the site:
- Registration and Login with user authentication
- Errors displaying for connection, autherntication, validation issues and more.
- User roles and page guards. (You won't get there in a shady way, don't try it!)
- Exclusive user editting functions for admin users. (Imagine getting a cool name and some admin change it!)
- Cool attribute pictures to make creature profiles look 'lit'!
- Getting kicked out of the profile when have some connection issues or session expires (Sorry 'bout it)
### Expected in near future:
- Creature editting system, drops, lvl/power-ups
- Your own user account edit panel. (You can get that cool name back)
- Profile pictures upload system. (Keep it SFW, please)
- Creature avatar pics also. (More pics that I will pirate from RPG games...)
- Monetization to pay for creature drops based on RNG. (I mean you cant have everything you want I guess)
- Teams and PVP System?


## Yea, cloning the repo is hard work to do. Here's some lazy preview: (cuz we all like pictures!)
